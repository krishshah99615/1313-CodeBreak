## Pitch:
What good is a democracy if the citizens have to wait for long hrs just to cast their vote and go through all the unnecessary efforts just to get the details verified. And moreover, there's no guarantee of any security for the votes not being manipulated at the backend.
To eliminate all such inconveniences and to facilitate super fast and convenient voting, team 1313 has come up with an optimal solution of securing the voting transactions by using the latest technologies like android and blockchain.
Votercoin is a blockchain-based e-voting system developed for android application, which aims at replacing all the current unfit voting systems available throughout the nation.

## Technolofy Stack Used
* Python
* Android
* MongoDb
## Some Hightlights
 We are trying to implement our block chian over ethereum network ,but we are not able to implement due to, unable to fetch the wallet address into mongodb.
 We do have our Smart contract ready and working .
